# Surveillance-Cameras-Greedy-search-A-Hill-climbing-Simulated-annealing-
a program that finds the minimum number of cameras to cover all the cells in a room. It takes a text file that represents the map of a room as an input. We solved the problem Using Best-first search algorithms (Greedy search &amp; A*) and Local search algorithms (Hill climbing &amp; Simulated annealing).
